# The classic 555 timer

This chip is ancient, yet still around and produced to this day, for good reason. It's like the paperclip or bic pen. When I was getting into the swing of things as far as working on electronics projects, I found myself wanting a version of the 555 timer that was already fully configured with jellybean components. I used the astable configuration most often, so I decided to go with this.

The board allows for either through-hole or surface mount (1206) resistors in the same place, and an optional diode if you want <50% duty cycle. There are two holes for power, and two for output and ground.

# I'm not necessarily done with this idea.

In the future, I'll remake this board using tiny 555 timers in the TSSOP-8 package, shown here:

And I want to try to fit it all in a DIP or 600-mil wide DIP format. I'll update this page if and when that happens.
